# Web-Design-for-Everybody-Capstone

The importance of validating your code during the web development process.

Validation Tools

The primary tool discussed is the W3C validator (validator.w3.org), which has been used throughout the HTML course.
Other tools available include an HTML checker, mobile checker, CSS validator, link checker, and internationalization checker.
Validation Methods

There are three options for validation:
Uploading a URL (for hosted sites).
File upload (for complete HTML files).
Direct input (for validating specific HTML code snippets).
Example Validation Process

An example is provided where the speaker validates a page with various elements, identifying errors such as missing Alt attributes and obsolete code.
The process emphasizes fixing errors one at a time and revalidating to ensure compliance.
Best Practices

The speaker encourages developing a habit of coding and validating iteratively.
It is also suggested to use additional tools like Wave and to visually check the code for further accuracy.

The importance of accessibility in web design, emphasizing that proper syntax alone is not sufficient for creating accessible web pages.

Understanding Accessibility

Accessibility goes beyond syntax; it involves the semantics of HTML tags and their meanings for users.
Tools like WAVE from WebAIM can help validate web pages for accessibility, but they require deployed sites for testing.
Using the WAVE Tool

WAVE identifies errors such as missing alternative text for images and empty links, which are common issues in web design.
Alerts indicate potential problems that may require human review, such as suspicious alternative text or redundant title text.
Additional Resources and Best Practices

For sites not yet deployed, WebAIM offers checklists for testing keyboard accessibility, content scaling, and screen reader compatibility.
It's crucial to remember that human evaluation is necessary to ensure comprehensive accessibility beyond automated tools.

Using developer tools for debugging code in web design.

Understanding Developer Tools

Different browsers have unique developer tools, but they share many similarities.
The lecture demonstrates using Chrome's Inspect Element feature to debug code.
Using Inspect Element

Users can access Inspect Element by right-clicking or through the browser's menu.
The tool can be undocked or docked to different positions for better visibility while working.
Debugging Process

The speaker identifies issues in the code, such as an unclosed div affecting layout.
Checking the console for JavaScript errors is essential for effective debugging.
Preserving Error Messages

The "Preserve log" option helps keep error messages visible for easier troubleshooting.
The lecture emphasizes that debugging is a learning process, and using these tools can enhance coding skills.

Creating a sticky footer in web design, explaining two methods to achieve this.

Sticky Footer with Fixed Height

The footer is set to a fixed height (e.g., 75 pixels) and positioned at the bottom of the page.
A container is created to hold the main content, ensuring it takes up the available height while leaving space for the footer.
Sticky Footer with Dynamic Height

This method uses CSS Flexbox to create a footer that adjusts based on content size.
The body is set to display as a flex container with a column direction, allowing the footer to remain at the bottom without a fixed height.
Both methods ensure the footer stays at the bottom of the page, enhancing the layout of the web design.

Embedding a Google Calendar into a web page using HTML.

Embedding a Google Calendar

It is recommended to use provided code from Google Calendar instead of hard coding a calendar.
The process involves accessing the calendar settings and copying the embed code.
Customizing the Calendar

Users can customize the calendar's appearance, including color, size, and options like showing the title or navigation buttons.
Responsive design considerations are important, such as displaying a month view on large screens and an agenda view on smaller screens.
Final Steps

After customizing, users should copy the final code into their HTML file.
The importance of validating the code for accessibility and style is emphasized to ensure a clean and user-friendly design.

Understanding and implementing a Lightbox feature for web design.

Lightbox Overview

A Lightbox is a user interface element that displays images in a full-screen overlay, enhancing the viewing experience.
It often includes features like a close button and the ability to navigate through a set of images in a carousel format.
Implementing Lightbox

To add a Lightbox to a website, search for "Lightbox JavaScript" to find suitable scripts.
The tutorial discusses a specific script that allows for grouping images using the data-lightbox attribute, enabling carousel functionality.
Customizing Lightbox Code

The tutorial emphasizes understanding the code structure, including anchor links and attributes like data-title for captions.
Users are encouraged to make small modifications to the code to personalize their Lightbox implementation while giving credit to the original authors.

Using Font Awesome to enhance web design with scalable icons.

Understanding Font Awesome

Font Awesome provides a collection of downloadable icons that can be easily integrated into web pages.
Icons can be customized using CSS and do not require JavaScript for implementation.
Incorporating Icons into Web Pages

Users can either download the Font Awesome code or use a CDN link for easy access.
The icons are added using the <i> tag with specific classes to denote the desired icon.
Customizing Icons

Icons can be resized and styled using additional classes or custom CSS.
Examples include changing colors and opacity to fit the design of the webpage.
Creating Dynamic Elements

Font Awesome allows for the creation of animated elements, such as loading spinners.
These elements can be integrated with JavaScript for dynamic functionality on the webpage.
